# OCR-using-3-layered-neural-networks
This is my implementation of 3 layered neural networks from scratch (without using any third-party library) for the purpose of recognising hand-written characters and numbers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to install one of the following softwares

```
Matlab
or
Octave
```

## Running the code

Within Matlab, just navivate to the directory containing the code files. In the command line write

```
runNN
```
and press enter. This will run the code which will step you through training of the neural network.
